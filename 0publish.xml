    0publish makes creating and modifying injector interface files easier.
    It can create a new commented template for you or edit an existing one.

    Various editing operations are available, the most basic being to let you
    edit it in your preferred text editor. It automatically removes the
    signature when loading an interface and creates a new one when writing it
    back out. It will also validate the new version before saving it.
