# 0publish

0publish makes creating and modifying Zero Install feed files easier.
It can create a new commented template for you or edit an existing one.

Various editing operations are available, the most basic being to let you
edit it in your preferred text editor. It automatically removes the
signature when loading an interface and creates a new one when writing it
back out. It will also validate the new version before saving it.
